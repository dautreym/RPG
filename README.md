# RPG

This is a beta-version of a RPG i'm creating all by myself, so it's obviously not perfect.

I just finished working on graphics, so they are available!!

Note that you will still need a terminal (see below) if you really want all data regarding what's happening in the game, but you are fully able to play without looking at it ;)

You can download all files with the "Clone or Download" button.

Then open in a terminal, move on your Download folder and write the following instructions :

unzip RPG-master.zip

cd RPG-master

python3 Main.py

!! IMPORTANT !! 

This is still a beta version, so think about saving your adventure after each important action !!

Thank you for your understanding :)

!! ALSO IMPORTANT !!
