# RPG

This is a beta-version of a RPG i'm creating all by myself, so it's obviously not perfect.

I'm currently working on graphics, which are not fully available for now.

If you want a full-working version (without graphics), please use only the "RPG_all_data.py" file (you can execute it using "python3 RPG_all_data.py" in a terminal).

Otherwise you can dowload all "UPDATED" files and play using "python3 Main.py" in a terminal (then think about saving your adventure after each important action).

Thank you for your understanding :)

If you like it or want to improve it, feel free to send me a feedback at dautreym@gmail.com ;)
